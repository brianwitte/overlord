JVM-based Network Protocol Framework
=======================================

:Author: Development Team
:Date: 2025-06-15
:Status: RFC
:Version: 0.1

OVERVIEW
--------

This document outlines the development of a JVM-based network protocol analysis 
and manipulation framework to replace the existing Canape tool. The new framework
will provide feature parity while leveraging modern JVM capabilities, Clojure's
functional programming paradigms, and improved architecture patterns.

RATIONALE
---------

Current limitations of Canape:
- Windows/.NET dependency limits cross-platform deployment
- Limited extensibility for custom protocol implementations  
- Steep learning curve for protocol graph configuration
- Performance bottlenecks in high-throughput scenarios
- Maintenance overhead of C#/.NET codebase

Benefits of JVM-based approach:
- True cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Rich ecosystem of networking and security libraries
- Clojure's REPL-driven development for rapid prototyping
- Better integration with existing Java security tools
- Improved performance through JVM optimizations

The proposed JVM-based replacement for Canape represents a significant opportunity
to modernize network protocol analysis and security testing workflows. By leveraging
Clojure's expressiveness and the JVM's performance characteristics, we can deliver
a more maintainable, extensible, and powerful framework for the security community.

The phased approach ensures steady progress while allowing for community feedback
and course correction. Success will be measured not only by technical capabilities
but also by adoption and community engagement.

Next steps:
1. Stakeholder review and approval of this proposal
2. Formation of core development team
3. Detailed technical design and prototyping
4. Community outreach and early adopter recruitment
